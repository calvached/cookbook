#Noodle-free Chicken Soup
Super easy light weight chicken soup!

##Ingredients:
Some chicken (I like to use drumsticks)  
2 cans (16oz) of Chicken broth (low sodium)  
Carrots (frozen or fresh, sliced)  
Peas  
Celery, sliced (with leaves still on)  
1 Small white onion, quartered  
1 Zucchini, bite size pieces  
1 Chayote, bite size pieces (usually in the squash section, near the Zucchini)  
1 Bay leaf  
Salt  

##Directions:
1. Place chicken, chicken broth and additional water in a large pot. Set heat to medium or medium high and cook at a low boil for 20 minutes.
1. Once chicken is mostly cooked, remove from the pot and set aside to cool.
1. Place all the veggies in the pot.
1. Make sure to skim any foam that may float to the top.
1. Once chicken is cool to the touch, shred and place back into the pot for another 10 minutes.
1. Add salt to taste then enjoy!

##Notes
The quantities of all these items (minus the broth and drumsticks) are forgiving so feel free to add more or less of each.
