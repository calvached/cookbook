# Spicy Spaghetti
I love Spaghetti

## Ingredients:
2 lb ground beef (I prefer the leanest kind)  
2 habaneros (or Sriracha if you have that on hand) - finely chopped  
1 medium yellow onion - diced  
1 package of fresh whole mushrooms (or 2 cans of sliced mushrooms) - halved or sliced  
1 celery stalk  
1 red pepper  
6 garlic cloves (or use prepared minced garlic to taste) - minced or smashed  
5 dried whole cloves  
1 bay leaf  
Pepper (to taste)  
Salt (to taste)  
Dried oregano (to taste)  
Dried basil (to taste)  
Parmesan (to taste)  

## Sauce Ingredients:
* Making this sauce is not necessary, you can just as easily use a prepared sauce (such as Prego, Bertolli, etc)  

1 can of tomato sauce (low sodium or no added salt preferred)  
1 cans of diced tomatoes (low sodium or no added salt preferred)  
1/2 can of tomato paste  
1 can beef broth (low sodium/water also works)  

## Directions:
1. Add salt and pepper to the beef and fry in a large pan until the beef starts to brown.
1. Once the beef is cooked, place it in a large pot (you'll also be using this pot for the sauce).
1. In the same large pan, cook your diced onion, red pepper, garlic, celery, and habanero.
1. Once the veggies are cooked, place them in the large pot.
1. In the large pot, add your tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, tomato paste (add your Sriracha here if you opted out of the habanero), mushrooms (drained if canned), cloves, bay leaf, oregano, basil, and beef broth/water (to your preferred consistency). 
1. Keep on medium-low heat for 20 minutes, then switch to a simmer for 30 minutes.
1. Taste the sauce and add more salt if needed.
1. 10 minutes prior to serving cook your noodles (I like zucchini noodles)
1. Sprinkle some parmesan and serve!

## Notes:
* I've been using some variety of this recipe since I was 23 and originally didn't use any fresh ingredients (canned was easier to store and use). To honor the spirit of the OG recipe, I've maintained most of the original ingredients as alternatives to the main ingredients. Feel free to mix and match, it's still tasty.
