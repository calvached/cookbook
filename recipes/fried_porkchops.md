# Fried Porkchops
Quick receipe for when I don't feel like getting fancy. Everything is "to taste" in this one, use your best judgement.

## Ingredients:
Flour  
Cayenne Pepper  
Ground Black Pepper  
Salt  
Thin cut pork chops  
Butter (or butter alternative)

## Directions:
1. In a plate combine flour, cayenne pepper, and black pepper.
1. Season the pork chops with salt and pepper then completely cover the pork chops with the flour mixture.
1. Shake off any excess flour and set aside.
1. In a large skillet heat enough vegetable oil to cover the entire bottom surface plus a bit more. 
1. As the oil is warming up (at a medium heat) add a tablespoon of butter.
1. After the butter has melted add your pork chops.
1. Cook the pork chops until the sides become a golden brown (about 2-3 minutes) then flip them over.
1. Wait 1-2 minutes before taking them out and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
