#Chipotle Brisket Tacos
Cheap and easy to make tacos! (need I say more?)

##Ingredients:
1 1/2 lbs of brisket  
Corn Tortillas  
Adobo  
Unground coriander  
Salt (to taste, I recommend adding this after the brisket is cooked)  
Black pepper (to taste)  
1 can chipotle peppers/sauce  
1 can green chiles (mild or hot)  
3 garlic cloves (crushed whole)  
1 small or medium red onion (sliced or chopped)  
1 small bunch of cilantro (chopped)  
1 small bag of Chihuahua cheese  
4 bay leaves (whole)  
limes or lime juice  

##Directions:
1. Season the brisket with Adobo and coriander then place in the slow cooker.
1. Place all the remaining ingredients, inside the slow cooker around the brisket.
1. Set cooker on low for 8-10 hours.
1. Serve on corn tortillas with Chihuahua cheese, cilantro and lime.

##Notes
This is a mild to medium spice recipe, add cayenne pepper or sriracha to make it spicier.
